/**
 * @brief Converts the current board state into a tensor representation suitable for the NN.
 *
 * Tensor dimensions: [Batch=1, Channels=33, Height=8, Width=8] <- UPDATED Channel Count
 * Channels:
 * Piece Channels (0-19):
 *   0-4:   Player RED pieces    (P, N, B, R, K) in UTIL_PIECE_TYPE_ORDER
 *   5-9:   Player BLUE pieces   (P, N, B, R, K)
 *   10-14: Player YELLOW pieces (P, N, B, R, K)
 *   15-19: Player GREEN pieces  (P, N, B, R, K)
 * Auxiliary Channels (20-32):
 *   20-23: Active player status (RED, BLUE, YELLOW, GREEN) - plane is 1.0 if active, 0.0 otherwise.
 *   24-27: Current player turn (RED, BLUE, YELLOW, GREEN) - plane for current player is 1.0, others 0.0.
 *   28-31: Player points normalized (Player Points / 100.0 for RED, BLUE, YELLOW, GREEN).
 *   32:    50-move counter normalized (Moves since last reset / 50.0, clamped to [0,1]).              
 * Note: Order of piece types within the 6 channels per player needs to be consistent.
 *
 * @param board The board object to convert.
 * @param device The torch device (e.g., torch::kCPU, torch::kCUDA) to create the tensor on.
 * @return A torch::Tensor representing the board state.
